#Anagram Finder

String <y> is an anagram of string <x> if <y> is a rearrangement of string <x>. 
This implies that <y> and <x> have the same letters with the same amount of each letter. Example: “code” and “deco” are anagrams!


- Each string will contain only characters that are from the first four letters of the English alphabet (‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’) and spaces. 
- All letters are in lowercase.
